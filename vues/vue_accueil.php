            <p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. With gusto. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
            <p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. <strong> Clamps, burn down the crew.</strong> <em> Eeeee!</em> Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>
            <h3>That's not soon enough!</h3>
            <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li><li>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</li><li>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</li>

            <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
            <p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? <strong> It's a fez.</strong> <em> I wear a fez now.</em> Fezes are cool.</p>
